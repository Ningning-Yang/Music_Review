    <p>Not surprisingly, the American singer Andy Grammer comes back to us with a great song called The Good Parts from The Good Parts Album. It is clear that Andy is trying to show us a great concept by making his song name the same as the album name! The Good Parts song reminds us to not forget the good parts even in our difficulties! </p>
    <p>Grammer explained why he titled his album after this song by saying If someone does a memoir, there is a piece of the memoir that everybody really wants to hear about the good parts, that is what we want. I want you to tell me what it is to be alive as you”.</p>
